<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<h3>Power-building and tenant rights in Ann Arbor</h3>
<p>
  Exploited and mistreated, tenants occupy a precarious position in
  the tenant-landlord relationship. In recent times, the cost of
  living has continued to increase as wages have stagnated. Many
  renters are left behind, facing increasingly costly rents, hostile
  landlords, expensive and stressful housing searches, and threat of
  eviction. In Ann Arbor, the skyrocketing rents and a shortage of
  affordable housing have left tenants feeling frustrated and worried.
  Current state and local laws do not provide sufficient tenant
  protections. Preliminary survey results show that many Ann Arbor
  tenants have dealt with unresponsive maintenance requests, dangerous
  or improperly maintained living conditions all while paying too much
  for rent.
</p>
<p>
  This Bill of Rights reflects collective demands of Ann Arbor tenants
  and supporters of fair and affordable housing. We, the members of
  the Ann Arbor Tenants Union and the Huron Valley Democratic
  Socialists of America, have drafted this Tenant Bill of Rights to
  address issues Ann Arbor renters are experiencing. We bring these
  concerns to our local government officials and demand our local
  representatives on the City Council and members of the judiciary
  help Ann Arborites receive better access to safe, fair, and
  affordable housing.
</p>
<h2 id="right-to-organize">1. Right to Organize</h2>
<p>
  Tenants deserve the right to organize — when landlords do things
  that are within the law that still negatively impact tenants, they
  should have the right to come together, talk and organize for their
  own protections. At the same time, absent a statewide, strong rent
  control measure, tenant-led organizing is the
  <em>only</em> sustainable way the cost of rent can be managed by
  tenants. Tenant organizing across the country has led to several
  recent wins for renters. We believe that tenant organizing is an
  essential tool that should be protected.
</p>
<p>The Right to Organize entails several protections. We demand:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>The right to perform outreach.</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          Tenant unions, or unions of any kind, cannot form or
          function if tenants are banned from interacting with their
          neighbors. Unfortunately,
          <a

            href="http://bit.ly/StopEvictionA2Woods"
            ><u>we’ve already seen</u></a
          >
          this kind of harassment and repression in Ann Arbor. For
          instance, representatives of Hayman Company management
          company at Ann Arbor Woods threatened eviction and arrest
          when demanding we [AATU] cease all flyering and
          doorknocking.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <em
            >Accordingly, we demand protections for the distribution
            of literature relating to tenants’ rights under tenants’
            doors or in common areas, and protections for anyone
            knocking on doors to discuss tenants’ issues or an
            organizing campaign.</em
          >
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>The right to gather.</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          Tenants can only inform each other of their issues, rights,
          and strategies to fight for better conditions if they can
          freely communicate with each other and gather.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          We demand that the City of Ann Arbor prevent landlords from
          restricting tenants in any way from gathering in common
          areas for any reason.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>The right to non-interference.</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          We demand that the City of Ann Arbor prevent landlords from
          intimidating, retaliating, or discriminating against tenants
          for their participation in a union. This includes, but is
          not limited to, any communications to tenants disparaging
          organizing efforts, providing preferential treatment in the
          form of discounts to tenants who do not participate in union
          activities, threatening to raise rent or evict tenants that
          participate in union organizing activities, and calling the
          police on gatherings of tenants.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>The right to collectively bargained leases.</strong>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          We demand that City Council pass an ordinance requiring
          landlords to engage in good-faith bargaining with
          collectives of tenants for their leases. The power built by
          tenant unions structurally cannot be based solely on one
          time small changes in additional benefits. And as long as we
          lack legal protections and recognition landlords will
          continue to raise rents and further living quality.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  These are not new proposals, some Michigan senators, including our
  own Jeff Irwin proposed these very same rights in

    href="https://www.legislature.mi.gov/Bills/Bill?ObjectName=2024-SB-0900"
    ><u>Senate Bill 900 of 2024</u></a
  >. These champions are still fighting for better tenant protections
  but are highly unlikely to pass given the current situation. The
  passage of strong protections for tenant organizers in Ann Arbor
  will pave the way for other municipalities, future efforts in the
  State of Michigan, and the national tenants’ movement.
</p>
<h2 id="right-to-rent-control">2. Right to Rent Control</h2>
<p>
  Tenants deserve the right to affordable housing. Unfortunately,
  housing is treated as a commodity rather than a human right. We
  demand a reality in which no one is rent burdened and everyone is
  housed.
  <a
    target="_blank"
    rel="noreferrer"
    href="https://usafacts.org/answers/how-much-do-households-spend-on-rent/state/michigan/"
    ><u>Recent reports</u></a
  >
  show that Ann Arbor has the highest rent burden in Michigan, with
  33.9% of Ann Arborite’s income going towards rent. Additionally, in
  Michigan,
  <a
    target="_blank"
    rel="noreferrer"
    href="https://nlihc.org/sites/default/files/SHP_MI.pdf"
    ><u>26% of renters</u></a
  >
  spend more than half of their income on rent with a person needing
  to work over 80 hours a week at minimum wage to afford the average
  1-bed. This high cost of living is not sustainable for many
  residents, especially as rents continue to skyrocket. It has been
  <a
    target="_blank"
    rel="noreferrer"
    href="https://peoplesaction.org/wp-content/uploads/Economist-Sign-on-Letter_-FHFA-RFI-Response-1.pdf"
    ><u>proven</u></a
  >
  time and time again that high rents in cities negatively impact
  communities. Thus, we ask for affordable housing to help our
  neighbors and make the city a better place to live for everyone.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>We demand the right to rent control</strong>. We demand our
  state legislature repeal Act 226 of 1988, which forbids rent control
  in the state of Michigan. Repealing this legislation would improve
  the lives of renters across the state. Ultimately, there should be
  no paywall for housing, as it is a <strong>human right</strong>.
  Nonetheless, our long-term fight must be done incrementally, with
  the most reasonable and rapid steps to be taken first to aid our
  low-income and homeless neighbors. Given the high
  <a

    ><u>number</u></a
  >
  of evictions across the state and the well-documented, devastating
  impacts of eviction, making housing more affordable would improve
  the lives of Michiganders. Upon successful repeal of Act 226, we
  demand the City of Ann Arbor pass rent control legislation.
  Considering the amount of time and additional funding to build more
  housing in Ann Arbor, rent control is the fastest and most effective
  way to make Ann Arbor more livable. It will stabilize the unchecked
  rental growth that has made housing inaccessible for our neighbors.

    for non renewal of a tenant’s lease.</strong

  Just cause may include nonpayment of rent, violating the terms of
  the lease, engaging in illegal activity, or the landlord moving into
  the unit currently occupied by the tenant.
</p>
<p>
  Furthermore,
  <strong
    >we demand the automatic expungement of eviction records</strong
  >
  two years after summary proceedings are finalized.
</p>
<p>

  ><strong>.</strong> The practice of charging exorbitant late fees
  immediately after a missed rent payment is punitive and serves only
  to increase instability for tenants, ultimately making eviction a
  more likely outcome.
</p>
<p>
  In cases where evictions do occur, the city can and must act to
  reduce the harm caused to individuals and their communities when
  someone is forced out of their home.
</p>
<p>
  <strong
    >We demand a required notice period for evictions of at least
    three months before a landlord can take legal action to have
    tenants evicted</strong
  >. This period would be essential to allow those subject to eviction
  notices to either remedy the cause of their eviction or find
  alternate housing.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>We demand mandated relocation assistance</strong> in the
  case of eviction due to the landlords’ sale or renovation of a
  building, or because the landlord has gone out of business or chosen
  to stop renting units in that building.
</p>
<h2 id="right-to-counsel">4. Right to Counsel</h2>
<p>
  When tenants do face eviction, they must not do so alone! Ann Arbor,
  like most of the country, does not guarantee legal representation in
  civil court proceedings such as evictions. In courtrooms where the
  odds are already stacked against us,
  <a
    target="_blank"
    rel="noreferrer"
    href="https://civilrighttocounsel.org/uploaded_files/280/Landlord_and_tenant_eviction_rep_stats__NCCRC_.pdf"
    ><u>tenants are left to fend for</u> <u>ourselves</u>
    <u
      >in court, while landlords hire attorneys to protect their
      interests.</u
    ></a
  >
  The unjust ramifications of a system like this are clear — when
  tenants have legal representation in eviction proceedings,
  <a
    target="_blank"
    rel="noreferrer"
    href="https://civilrighttocounsel.org/resources/organizing_around_right_to_counsel/#repstats"
    ><u
      >we are more likely to defeat the landlord's claim and remain in
      our homes</u
    ></a
  >. Additionally, we pay less in court costs and, in cases where the
  eviction does proceed, have more time to find a new apartment. In
  Detroit, where a Right to Counsel program was launched in 2023,
  <a
    target="_blank"
    rel="noreferrer"

    ><u
      >46% of tenants who were represented in eviction proceedings
      remained in their homes</u
    ></a
  >.
</p>
<p>
  Most importantly, the right to counsel shifts the balance of power
  in Ann Arbor. Eviction court today is a tool by which landlords
  exert control over their property and exercise power over tenants.
  Statistics don’t capture the cases that aren’t brought when
  landlords know they will have to face a lawyer in court. With the
  right to counsel, landlords would have to think twice before
  bringing baseless cases to bully or intimidate their tenants. When
  they did initiate proceedings, they would have to fight to prove
  their case.
</p>
<p>
  <strong
    >We demand full legal representation be provided to [income
    qualifying] tenants facing eviction proceedings, free of
    charge.</strong
  >
  Tenants should be informed of the program when they receive an
  eviction notice, and have access to their lawyer within 15 days of
  the receipt of the notice. Legislation for this purpose

  in 2023 in the state legislature, and highlighted as part of the
  Michigan Coalition Against Homelessness’ Housing Homestretch
  Campaign — but it never succeeded. We plan to build the power needed
  to win the Right to Counsel decisively in Ann Arbor.
</p>
<h2 id="right-to-truth-in-renting">5. Right to Truth in Renting</h2>
<p>
  Landlords love to swindle tenants out of every dollar and penny they
  can — by hiding key information about units, omitting fees from
  leases, and by taking advantage of the opaque nature of the Ann
  Arbor housing market. We demand a complete end to this practice.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>We demand a complete ban on junk fees,</strong>
  <a
    target="_blank"
    rel="noreferrer"
    href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CWNVNBg6sSIdECponPv_9CWHQwoNw0iaaol4CDNNK60/edit?tab=t.0"
    ><u>continuing our call in 2024</u></a
  >
  for City Council to ban all rental junk fees. City Council made a
  strong reduction of waitlist fees in January 2025, but tenants in
  Ann Arbor are used to an assortment of other hidden fees like
  administrative fees, move-in fees, move-out fees, cleaning fees,
  lease change fees, late fees, “no-hassle fees”, waitlist fees,
  options fees, holding fees, sublet fees, reservation fees, pet fees,
  parking fees, trash fees, and more. These fees are seldom
  transparent and rarely correspond to legitimate, tangible services.
</p>
<p>
  We demand that landlords be required to
  <strong
    >provide to all applicants an option to tour the unit</strong
  >
  that the applicant seeks to rent. Even with the other forms of
  transparency fought for in the Right to Truth in Renting, landlords
  can and will attempt to deceive tenants into paying rent for subpar
  housing. Issues with housing are easily hidden by the photos and
  websites landlords use to show their units. Tenants deserve a live,
  physical inspection of the unit they plan to rent — tours of “sample
  units” and video call tours do not suffice.
</p>
<p>
  Finally, we demand that the City of Ann Arbor
  <strong>maintain a public rent registry</strong>, containing basic
  information on rental units each landlord holds including the rent
  being charged and the number of bedrooms and bathrooms included in a
  given unit. Only when tenants can make a fair comparison of leases
  they are negotiating with other units can they avoid being pressured
  into paying exorbitant rates for shoddy housing. In establishing a
  rent registry, the City would follow numerous other municipalities
  in providing transparency to tenants, including

<p>
  <strong
    >Housing is a human right — and that means everyone deserves
    access to a fair housing application process.</strong
  >
  Searching for housing can be stressful and costly for potential
  tenants, and addressing discriminatory practices in the rental
  process makes the application process easier and more equitable. We
  have seen this in Ann Arbor for example take the form as immense
  pre-tenancy fees and much more.
</p>
<p>
  Michigan already has significant protections regarding housing
  access through the federal Fair Housing Act, which prohibits
  discrimination because of race, skin color, national origin,
  religion, sex, familial status, or disability, but this stops short
  of making housing accessible for everyone. Taking inspiration from
  and extending

  housing based on <strong>criminal history</strong>,
  <strong
    >credit scores, eviction history, or history of
    homelessness.</strong
  >
</p>
<p>
  Banning discrimination requires expansive action — landlords are
  well-known for their insistence on skirting fair housing laws
  through creative language, refusing to disclose reasons for denials,
  and of course simply breaking the law blatantly. To fight this
  practice effectively and enshrine a Right to Housing Access for all
  in Ann Arbor, the City must prohibit landlords from asking about
  tenants about any of the above protected features, they must
  prohibit landlords from advertising that rental units are not
  available to or otherwise providing misleadingly exclusive
  advertising, and must prohibit landlords from making any decision at
  all affected by their knowledge of any of these categories. The City
  must also act swiftly and decisively through proportionate fines to
  deter this kind of discrimination when it does occur.
</p>
<h2 id="right-to-repair-and-deduct">7. Right to Repair and Deduct</h2>
<p>
  Ann Arbor is a town that constantly fluctuates between who is
  renting what due to the University of Michigan. Combined with the
  highly competitive housing market, landlords have allowed properties
  to fall into disrepair, or generally maintain rental units at a
  lower quality. There have been plenty of examples where, even the
  repairs, break down within days of the proposed “fix”.
</p>
<p>
  To combat this, we demand the city of Ann Arbor pass additional,
  clearer legislature to ensure all housing within Ann Arbor is
  <strong>habitable.</strong> Specifically:
</p>
<ol type="1">
  <li>
    <p>
      Allow tenants to
      <strong
        >withhold rent in an escrow account if landlords are not
        making repairs in a timely manner</strong
      >. This is particularly important if the state of the rental
      property is unsafe.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Legally
      <strong>codify right to repair and deduct provisions</strong>.
      This will allow tenants to make repairs themselves, and deduct
      the cost from their rent. Many other states and cities have
      successfully enacted such policies.
    </p>
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  Currently,
  <a
    target="_blank"
    rel="noreferrer"
    href="https://legislature.mi.gov/Laws/MCL?objectName=MCL-125-534"
    ><u>the Act 167 of 1917 in the Michigan Housing Law</u></a
  >
  states renters can make a repair hand deduct its cost from rent
  after a judge has authorized the repair. Of course, most tenants do
  not have the time or money to bring these cases to court to get such
  approval. Stronger repair and deduct precedents exist in practice;
  as established in
  <a
    target="_blank"
    rel="noreferrer"
    href="https://www.courts.michigan.gov/siteassets/publications/benchbooks/lltbb/lltbb.pdf?r=1"
    ><em><u>Anchor Inn of Mich, Inc v Knopman</u></em>
    <u>(71 Mich App 64, 67, 1976))</u></a
  >, common law was established that further strengthens the right to
  repair and deduct when the tenant is not the cause of the unsafe
  conditions.
</p>
<p>
  These are insufficient.
  <strong>Clear legal language has not been codified</strong> to allow
  tenants to make repairs themselves, or to withhold rent in response
  to poor housing conditions. Tenants are therefore left guessing with
  respect to the timelines in which the repair and deduct process can
  take place and how much to deduct from their rent payments as a
  result of the repair. Uncertainty around this process leads to fear
  of retaliation from landlords, who can allege tenants are
  incorrectly exercising their rights and take them to court — an
  everyday occurrence for landlords and their corporate lawyers, but a
  threat to livelihoods and stability for tenants.
</p>
<p>
  Tenants can’t exercise their rights when they’re threatened with
  retaliation at every turn — we need codification and protection now!
</p>
<h2 id="right-to-a-fair-lease">8. Right to a Fair Lease</h2>
<p>
  As tenants, our apartments are our homes, they aren’t just places to
  live. We should have the right to live and use our apartments
  without being subject to the arbitrary whims of the landlord!
</p>
<p>
  <strong
    >We demand the city create a framework for just and sensible
    leases,</strong
  >
  expanding the number of terms that are banned from being included in
  the lease and creating ways to ensure that all leases are fully
  compliant with the law. The Rights and Duties booklet, a
  standardized third-party document of rights distributed to all
  tenants, explicitly acknowledges landlords’ coercive power with
  lease creation, saying that leases “often contain clauses that are
  misleading or unenforceable to intimidate tenants who don’t know the
  law.”
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      Leases in Ann Arbor often have unenforceable clauses and
      landlords are never punished for that — they trick and coerce
      tenants into signing clauses
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The lease cannot:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          Infringe on tenants freedom of expression — we should have
          the right to display posters and flyers in their windows, on
          their porches or patios and in other exterior areas of the
          apartment.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Allow the landlord to trespass the guests of tenants (except
          in the rare case that the guest poses a danger to tenants or
          community members).
        </p>
      </li>
      <li><p>Limit access to or usage of common spaces.</p></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Additionally,
  <strong
    >leases must always be open to negotiation on specific
    terms</strong
  >. Generally, leases are contracts of adhesion — tenants are
  expected to sign the lease as presented by the landlord in exchange
  for access to housing. This is unacceptable. We demand an
  enforcement mechanism to ensure that landlords engage in good faith
  negotiations with tenants over the terms of their lease.
</p>
<p>
  Finally,
  <strong
