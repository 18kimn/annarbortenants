            <strong>Why should I be a member?</strong>
          </em>
        </p>
        <p>
          Unfortunately, the past fifty years has shown that no
          nonprofit, government agency, developer, or (God forbid)
          landlord can save us — only tenants can, by assembling and
          wielding our collective power. Alone, our rents are a
          burden, but together those rents are our leverage into
          ensuring each landlord will never exploit tenants again.
          Becoming a member of your tenants union is the first step to
          winning that power.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a member, you’ll be supported by other members of the Ann
          Arbor Tenants Union, with everything in our power to support
          you, in every struggle you have as a tenant. When your
          landlord ignores pests in your house, lets your roof drip,
          raises your rent, or cuts your lease early — your fellow
          members of the AATU will be there to yell alongside you, to
          recruit legal help with you, and to mobilize your fellow
          residents so your landlord will <em>never</em> be able to do
          this to you or other tenants again.
        </p>

          <em>
            I joined the AATU because I wanted to stop being just
            being informed about what was going on in the world and
            begin doing something about it. This is collective praxis
            and a great way to create community!”

          First, join our primary Signal group:{' '}
          <a href="http://bit.ly/AATUSignal">
            <u>bit.ly/AATUSignal</u>
          </a>{' '}
          (our membership form should direct you to this after you
          fill it out). This group chat is our primary home for
          day-to-day conversations and updates. If you prefer not to
          download a new app or join a new chat, that’s okay, there
          are other ways to keep up and get caught up that are listed
          here.
        </p>
        <p>
          Second, meet with an AATU organizer to talk about your
          experience as a renter and what you’re interested in
          organizing around with your fellow renters. We try to reach
          out to everyone that fills out the form proactively, but if
          you haven’t heard from us in a few weeks or would like to
          meet sooner, please send us a message at{' '}
          <a href="mailto:annarbortenantsunion@gmail.com">
            <u>annarbortenantsunion@gmail.com</u>
          </a>
          . 
        </p>
        <p>
          That conversation with an existing organizer should
          hopefully identify paths for you within AATU that are right
          for you. But generally, we recommend a few options, most
          valuable being listed first:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              <strong>Get to know other members of the AATU</strong> —
              it’s most important for us as tenants seeking to effect
              change to create a strong and tight-knit community of
              organizers that can support each other in the fight.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <strong>Talk with your immediate neighbors.</strong> For
              the most part, we’re isolated in our own complexes, and
              need to rebuild the social bonds that have been robbed
              from us by parasites (landlords) in order to build
              effective unions.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <strong>Join the AATU organizing committee.</strong> As
              a coordinating group within AATU generally, we share
              strategies across complexes and work together on
              citywide campaigns. This group is our most important
              formation for expanding the AATU and building tenant
              power.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <strong>Join a different subcommittee.</strong> AATU’s
              bread and butter is complex-level organizing that
              requires folks to simply talk to each other and to their
              neighbors, but we are an ambitious org with many needs —
              we need social media content, people knowledgeable with
              finance, people who are willing to lead legislative
              priorities, people to build strong relationships with
              other organizations, and so on. 
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          <em>
            <strong>What are my duties as part of the union?</strong>
          </em>
        </p>
        <p>
          Becoming a member fundamentally is a commitment to your
          fellow tenants of Ann Arbor that you stand alongside them in
          our fight for a dignified home and community, and against
          the bad actor landlords that exploit tenants for personal
          gain. It’s a recognition that as tenants, we share
          interests; we all want dignified and affordable housing, and
          we’re all dealing with landlords who use the same tactics to
          deny us the housing we deserve. 
        </p>
        <p>
          AATU strives to be a democratic, member run organization.
          AATU members vote on major decisions of the union. More
          importantly, as an AATU member your active participation in
          our organizing work will shape the direction and capacity of
          our union as we work together to build tenant power in Ann
          Arbor. Lastly, we plan to begin collecting dues from members
          but strictly on a voluntary basis— we believe this is
          important for maintaining our independence.
