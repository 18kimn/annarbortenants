        <strong>What is a tenants union?</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        A tenant union is a group of tenants who stand together in an
        organization to use the collective power we hold as renters to
        fight for dignified housing, affordable rents, and,
        ultimately, an end to the commodification of housing. While
        our obligation to pay rent makes us vulnerable and disempowers
        us as individuals, wielding that identity collectively to
        threaten landlords’ sources of income is a massive source of
        power that we can use to win direct improvements to our living
        conditions.{' '}

        , well-organized tenants across the country have demonstrated
        that collectively mobilizing against landlords, up to and
        including going on long-haul rent strikes, wins the goods.

        A citywide tenant union like ours is a mass organization.
        Accordingly, the Ann Arbor Tenants Union is composed of
        several hundred tenants from all sorts of identities,
        backgrounds, affiliations, and politics, united over our
        shared structural relationship as renters. Members play a
        variety of different roles according to their strengths,
        ranging from informally assisting each other, to campaigning
        against a specific landlord, to developing a tenant
        association in a single building, to growing the citywide
        organization through individual conversations, to researching
        policy, to planning social media, to writing organizational
        infrastructure. Every single member is a crucial and
        indispensable part of this organization.

        As a tenants union, our first priority is to build a group of
        tenants fighting rent increases and landlord parasitism across
        Ann Arbor. We’re also in the early stages of our growth, so
        our capacity and funding is limited. This means we don’t have
        lawyers on staff or pro-bono lawyers we work with — we
        encourage tenants to visit the{' '}

        But we’re still eager to help you fight legal struggles of all

        We see “tenant” as broadly defined — anyone in housing they
        don’t own their place of residence. We invite students in
        university dorms, those living in hotels or SROs, those who
        are homeless, subletters, and those in sorority or fraternity
        housing. We also won’t ever ask you to show your lease to us
        so we have proof you’re a tenant, or anything like that.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you’re asking this question because you are unsure if
        you’re a tenant, we invite you to join one of our regular
        meetings (our calendar can be seen on the home page, and
        logistics are sent into our shared Signal group at{' '}

        We believe it’s important for union members to be tenants
        (that’s what we consider a tenants union to be). If you’re a
        homeowner that simply wants to show support or organize with
        us, you can offer solidarity dues or
