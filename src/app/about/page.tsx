        About the Ann Arbor Tenants Union
      </h1>
      <p>
        The Ann Arbor Tenants Union has a long and storied history.
        Students and community renters{' '}
        <a href="https://openyls.law.yale.edu/server/api/core/bitstreams/bb7e8b29-db9d-4ce5-b515-8bcca82592d1/content">
          <u>began</u>
        </a>
        the Ann Arbor Tenants Union in 1968 with a fiery beginning in
        the form of a three-year long rent strike, which forced
        landlords to the table and showed that organized tenants could
        wield real power. Over the next several decades, the AATU
        became a hub for tenant defense and education. In 1976, the
        AATU{' '}
        <a href="https://aadl.org/node/201294">
          <u>won recognition</u>
        </a>{' '}
        to collectively bargain leases with the landlord Trony-Sunrise
        Associates, a major milestone. By the 1980s, the AATU{' '}
        <a href="https://shelterforce.org/1995/03/01/ann-arbor-tenants-union/">
          <u>had a regular practice</u>
        </a>{' '}
        of collaborating with the University of Michigan Law School’s
        clinic and relying on a steady flow of student volunteers.{' '}
        <a href="https://archive.iww.org/history/library/misc/Kauffmann1993/">
          <u>Organizing efforts</u>
        </a>{' '}
        led by the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) steered the
        AATU during these periods continually towards mass
        organizing. 
      </p>
      <p>
        But decades of funding fights eventually took their toll, and
        in 2004, after years of struggling with budgetary shortfalls,
        the Ann Arbor Tenants Union{' '}
        <a href="https://www.michigandaily.com/content/rise-and-fall-ann-arbor-tenants-union">
          <u>closed its doors</u>
        </a>
        . The lesson of that history is clear: when tenants are
        resourced and organize themselves to fight, we win protections
        and reshape the balance of power in the city; when that
        infrastructure is gutted, landlords move quickly to exploit
        the vacuum.

        Flash forward to 2025: In the two decades since the AATU’s
        closure, it has become evident that tenants in Ann Arbor need
        to assemble their power in a union more than ever. According
        to{' '}

          <u>research</u>
        </a>{' '}
        by the National Low Income Housing Coalition, Ann Arbor has
        the highest percentage of renters in Michigan but is also
        Michigan’s most expensive city for renters.{' '}

        How can we fight this? The City can build more units, it can
        give subsidies to developers, it can innovate in statecraft,
        it can provide legal services for tenants. But without
        organized renters willing to fight back collectively, the
        City’s balance of power remains stuck in favor of landlords;
        landlords will <em>always</em> push money into politics to
        rewrite rules in their favor and grow rich from those same
        schemes meant to “help” tenants. More than service providers
        or well-meaning politicians, then, our city needs a fighting
        culture of tenants that win their own victories—wherein
        tenants themselves identify shared problems, deliberate
        together, take collective action, and through all of those win
        real and lasting victories at both the building and city
        levels.

        Enter the revitalized Ann Arbor Tenants Union, a collective of
        tenants formed in 2023 to forge that mass culture through
        no-shortcuts organizing, building by building. We’ve already
        notched important victories against landlords like Campus
        Management and Redwood Communities at the building level, and,
        at the city level, have won a ban on pre-tenancy junk fees and
        stronger versions of the Early Leasing Ordinance and Right to
        Renew (

          <u>the first versions</u>

        of which had also been won by AATU organizers the year prior
        to the revival of the AATU).

        Today, members are drafting a Tenants’ Bill of Rights to close
        loopholes and establish real penalties for landlords who break
        the law. At the time of writing, the union boasts more than
        250 members, with multiple active tenant associations across
        the city. We invite you to join your fellow unionized tenants
        in the Ann Arbor Tenants Union, not only so that we may
        protect each other from predatory landlord parasitism that
        easily exploits us as individuals, but also so that together,
        we can win the dignity and affordability for tenants that we
        deserve.
