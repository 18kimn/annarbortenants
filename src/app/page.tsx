              We are the <strong>Ann Arbor Tenants Union</strong>, a
              democratic collective of tenants in Ann Arbor fighting
              for <b>stable, just, and affordable housing</b> through
              wielding our shared burden &mdash; and power &mdash; as
              renters. Become a member of your union today with the
              form below.
            </p>
            <p>
              The housing crisis in Ann Arbor is out of control and
              it&apos;s up to us to organize and stop it. We
              won&apos;t wait for politicians, service providers, or
              landlord parasites to save us &mdash; we&apos;re
              organizing to protect ourselves and create better
              housing for everyone in Ann Arbor.
            </p>
            <p>
              We believe we can win lower rent, timely maintenance,
              and stability through the power we hold as renters
              paying for our landlords&apos; mortgages. They depend on
              us, and we can fight and <strong>win</strong> when we
              recognize that as our power and use it as leverage.
              Crucially, we&apos;re <strong>not</strong> a
              service-providing nonprofit, or a legal aid group, or
              even an advocacy organization. We&apos;re tenants like
              you.
